    <h3>Character Description:</h3>

    <p>Nadja of Antipaxos is a 500â‰ˆ year old vampire of Greek and Romani heritage. She is a main character in What We Do in the Shadows (TV series).
      Nadja was born in Greece sometime during the 15th century to an impoverished family during her human life.</p>

    <p>Her village, located on the island of Antipaxos, was once a utopia, until it was razed to the ground by the army of an unknown warrior (who's identity she would later discover as her future roommate, Nandor the Relentless) around 200 years before she was born.
      Only the "stupidest" people were spared, and the village never recovered, leaving its citizens badly affected by famine and poverty.</p>
      
    <p>Nadja's family was very poor, and had to burn donkey dung (and eventually the donkeys themselves) for warmth. When Nadja was young, her mother gave Nadja her own jade necklace just before she left and was promptly eaten by a bear; 
      her dying screams were apparently absorbed by the necklace.</p>
      
    <p>It is unclear how Nadja became a vampire, as she tells an entirely different story which conflicts with her husband, Laszlo's own account.
      Nadja claims that she was turned while working as a throat singer while singing to the island's snakes when a female vampire (in the form of a snake) bit and turned her. 
      Nadja was subsequently chased off the island by her fellow villagers, which included her family. However, according to Laszlo, it was Baron Afanas who turned her.</p>

    <p>One night, Nadja flew into the window of the English human Laszlo Cravensworth, seduced him, drank of his blood, and turned him into a vampire. The two eventually married. Laszlo became a member of the prestigious Sherwood Club, but was kicked out as they disapproved of his relationship with Nadja, who they deemed to be a peasant with no surname. Laszlo kept this hidden from Nadja and was so disgusted by the club's elitism that he vowed to leave the UK and never return. 
      Around 1861, the couple were driven out of Europe due to anti-vampire prejudice. They were shipped to the USA along with fellow vampire Simon the Devious.</p>
    
    <p>Laszlo and Nadja settled in Staten Island while Simon went to Manhattan and quickly took over the city's vampires. He set up a vampire nightclub, The Sassy Cat Club, which Nadja, Laszlo and Nandor frequented during the 1920s. During the mid-twentieth century, Nadja became good friends with the Rat Pack. She claims that Frank Sinatra was especially complimentary of her voice.
      At the time the documentary filming started, Nadja was living with Laszlo, the energy vampire Colin Robinson, Nandor and his familiar Guillermo in a house on Staten Island.</p>
